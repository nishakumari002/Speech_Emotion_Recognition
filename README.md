# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition is a task of speech processing and computational paralinguistics that aims to recognize and categorize the emotions expressed in spoken language. The goal is to determine the emotional state of a speaker, such as happiness, anger, sadness, or frustration, from their speech patterns, such as prosody, pitch, and rhythm.


___ Here's a concise step-by-step guide for a Speech Emotion Recognition project: ___

1. Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of audio recordings with labeled emotions.

2. Data Preprocessing: Convert audio to spectrograms/mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), normalize and segment data.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features (e.g., pitch, energy, spectral features) from the preprocessed audio.

4. Data Splitting: Divide dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70-15-15 split).

5. Model Selection: Choose a suitable model architecture (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks) for speech emotion recognition.

6. Model Design: Create a neural network model with appropriate layers and hyperparameters.

7. Model Training: Train the model on the training set using appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).

8. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model parameters using the validation set to optimize performance.

9. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

10. Results Analysis: Analyze confusion matrices and emotion-wise performance to understand model strengths and weaknesses.
