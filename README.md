# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition is a task of speech processing and computational paralinguistics that aims to recognize and categorize the emotions expressed in spoken language. The goal is to determine the emotional state of a speaker, such as happiness, anger, sadness, or frustration, from their speech patterns, such as prosody, pitch, and rhythm.
